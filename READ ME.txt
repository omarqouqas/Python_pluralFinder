Make sure the python app file is called "app.py"

SSH to the EC2 instance
cd to /home/ec2-user/plural_Goldsmiths

To create a virtual env, run:
python3 -m venv env

To activate the virtual env:
source env/bin/activate

then run: 
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5555


Then browse to the EC2 public IP (i.e., http://3.82.51.48:5555/), OR "http://ec2-3-82-51-48.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5555/"

Can also check if the flask instance is working locally by ssh'ing to server and using a local instance of the lynx text browser to verify the port is responding. ie


lynx localhost:<port_number>
lynx localhost:5555
